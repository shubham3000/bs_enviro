    <h2><strong>RO Plant Pre-Treatment</strong></h2>
    <p>
    An efficient pre-treatment is essential to enhance performance, membrane life and overall operating cost. As particulate matter presents in raw water, it becomes mandatory to pre-treat feed water in order to protect membranes from fouling or damaging ; therefore, pre- treatment directly impacts the performance of reverseosmosis membranes. It is the quality of feed water, which decides which pre-treatment method is required; media filtration (MGF/ACF), BagFilter, UV filtra tionand Ultra filtrationar ecommonre verseosmosispre - treatment solutions.

    <h2><strong>Ultrafiltration Process</strong></h2>
    <p>
    Ultrafiltration is another type of membrane filtration, which is pressure driven water filtration process. In ultrafiltration process membrane pore size plays important role; feed water is pressed into modules through pump,depending upon the specific pore size of membranes contaminants are rejected and filtered water is taken out in storage tank or further sent as RO feed water.
     </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    Ultrafiltration is considered more effective as compared to traditional water filtration. An ultrafiltration system is used in turbidity removal; in addition, it also removes bacteria, virus, micro organisms, particulate material, and natural organic materials from the water.

    <h2><strong>Demineralization Plant | DM Plant</strong></h2>
    <p>
    DM Plant is also known as Demineralization plant. It works on the operating principles of ion-exchange to remove the dissolved mineral ions like sodium, magnesium, calcium etc from the water. DM water plant has 3 vessels namely cation exchanger, anion exchanger & Mix-Bed ( Super charge ) vessel.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    When the water gets passed from these three vessels it becomes ion free. As the cations get exchanged with hydrogen ions in first bed, the anions are exchanged with hydroxyl ions, in the second one. The resultant water is chloride free having zero TDS & Zero conductivity. This water is called Demineralised water or Deionized water.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    We manufactures Demineralization (DM) Plants of wide ranges from smallest 100 LPH to industrial grade 50,000 LPH capacity for the industries need chloride free water for their operations
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>The Applications of Demineralization ( DM ) Plant are:</strong></h2>
    <p>
    In Cosmetics Industry : Cosmetics products are manufactured in Demineralised water to increase product quality & reduce the risks & impacts of salts on the skin.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    In Automobile Industry : DM Water is used in automobile batteries to ensure longer battery service life. The ions present in the normal water degrades the internal lead plates of the battery. In Boiler Applications : In boiler DM Water is used because it doesnâ€™t leave any residue & Scale formations inside the boiler.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    In Laboratory Applications : DM water is used laboratories during experimenting with various chemicals , as ions present in the normal water tend to modify the results & reaction can happen abnormally.

      Our company is a prominent manufacturer of multi grade filter and provides engineering services from designing, manufacturing to installation and commissioning. Our Multigrade sand filtration plants are designed to meet specific requirements of our customers; no matter what quality of water you use and what your flow rate requirements are, our engineering team is capable of configuring the same accordingly, we can manufacture and supply any capacity you need.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>Working Principle</strong></h2>
    <p>
    A latest concept in the water treatment technology, a Multi Grade Filter consists
    of vertical or horizontal pressure sand filters that contain multiple layers of
    coarse and fine sand (pebbles and gravels) in a fixed proportion. It is a kind of a
    deep filter bed with adequate pore dimensions for retaining both large and small
    suspended solids and un-dissolved impurities like dust particles. As compared
    to conventional sand water filter, this Multigrade filtration system works on
    higher specific flow rates.lt is also a Iow-cost pre-treatment system for ion
    exchangers (deionizer and softener) and membrane systems such as reverse
    osmosis etc. With high through puts, high dirt- holding capacity and capacity to
    reduce tur -bidity and TSS (< 20 ppm) from water, it protectsion- exchange resins
    and membranes from physical fouling due to suspended impurities present in
    the water. The next and last step is back washing, a process of effectively
    removal of captured contaminants from the media bed.
    Note: Vessel size will be provided as per requirement of client.

    Activated Carbon Filter is widely accepted system in water filtration techniques. The treated water is free
    from chloramines (chlorine and ammonia mixture) and organic compounds; therefore, best for discharge
    and production use. Activated Carbon Filter is also utilized inpre- treatment for RO water plant and DM plant
    as the treated water keeps these systems safe from oxidation or organic fouling.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>Working Principle</strong></h2>
    <p>
    An activated carbon filter (ACF) works on the principle of adsorption; filter medium
    adsorbs or reacts with a pollutant molecule then filtered water is drained out.
    Activated carbon which is used as medium to remove contaminants is natural
    material derived from coconut shell, lignite, bituminous coal etc. further, activated
    by chemical or steam under absence of oxygen with high temperature around
    10000C.Which Activated Carbon is Right for You? There are two types of activated
    carbons available, Granules Activated Carbon(GAC)and Powdered Activated Carbon
    (PAC); In general, Granule Activated Carbon is made by steam activation of coal and
    is widely used in purifying drinking water, whereas Powdered Activated Carbon is
    produced by steam activation of lignite coal under carefully controlled conditions
    and issued in treating (remove toxic organics along with BOD, COD and TOC)
    industrial waste water, process water and highly contaminated municipal waste
    water.

    Industrial water softener is a kind of water filter, which removes hardness from water causes due to
    presence of Calcium and Magnesium. For industries and commercial units, hard water poses a potential
    threat. The performance of boilers, cooling towers and other associated equipment adversely affected by
    scaling caused by hard water. Water Softener is considered as concrete solution for this problem, which
    prevents scale forming. We deal in industrial hard water treatment with manufacturing of water softener.
