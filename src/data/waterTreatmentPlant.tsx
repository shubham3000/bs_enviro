    <h2><strong>RO Plant Pre-Treatment</strong></h2>
    <p>
    An efficient pre-treatment is essential to enhance performance, membrane life and overall operating cost. As particulate matter presents in raw water, it becomes mandatory to pre-treat feed water in order to protect membranes from fouling or damaging ; therefore, pre- treatment directly impacts the performance of reverseosmosis membranes. It is the quality of feed water, which decides which pre-treatment method is required; media filtration (MGF/ACF), BagFilter, UV filtra tionand Ultra filtrationar ecommonre verseosmosispre - treatment solutions.

    <h2><strong>Ultrafiltration Process</strong></h2>
    <p>
    Ultrafiltration is another type of membrane filtration, which is pressure driven water filtration process. In ultrafiltration process membrane pore size plays important role; feed water is pressed into modules through pump,depending upon the specific pore size of membranes contaminants are rejected and filtered water is taken out in storage tank or further sent as RO feed water.
     </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    Ultrafiltration is considered more effective as compared to traditional water filtration. An ultrafiltration system is used in turbidity removal; in addition, it also removes bacteria, virus, micro organisms, particulate material, and natural organic materials from the water.

    <h2><strong>Demineralization Plant | DM Plant</strong></h2>
    <p>
    DM Plant is also known as Demineralization plant. It works on the operating principles of ion-exchange to remove the dissolved mineral ions like sodium, magnesium, calcium etc from the water. DM water plant has 3 vessels namely cation exchanger, anion exchanger & Mix-Bed ( Super charge ) vessel.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    When the water gets passed from these three vessels it becomes ion free. As the cations get exchanged with hydrogen ions in first bed, the anions are exchanged with hydroxyl ions, in the second one. The resultant water is chloride free having zero TDS & Zero conductivity. This water is called Demineralised water or Deionized water.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    We manufactures Demineralization (DM) Plants of wide ranges from smallest 100 LPH to industrial grade 50,000 LPH capacity for the industries need chloride free water for their operations
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>The Applications of Demineralization ( DM ) Plant are:</strong></h2>
    <p>
    In Cosmetics Industry : Cosmetics products are manufactured in Demineralised water to increase product quality & reduce the risks & impacts of salts on the skin.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    In Automobile Industry : DM Water is used in automobile batteries to ensure longer battery service life. The ions present in the normal water degrades the internal lead plates of the battery. In Boiler Applications : In boiler DM Water is used because it doesnâ€™t leave any residue & Scale formations inside the boiler.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
    In Laboratory Applications : DM water is used laboratories during experimenting with various chemicals , as ions present in the normal water tend to modify the results & reaction can happen abnormally.

      The activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution begins with an aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected into the waste water. This is followed by a settling tank to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water. Part of the waste sludge is recycled to the aeration tank and the remaining waste sludge is removed for further treatment and ultimate disposal.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>Process description</strong></h2>
    <p>
      The process takes advantage of aerobic micro-organisms that can digest organic matter in sewage, and clump together by flocculation entrapping fine particulate matter as they do so. It thereby produces a liquid that is relatively free from suspended solids and organic material, and flocculated particles that will readily settle out and can be removed.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items:</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor. Settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water. Treatment of nitrogenous or phosphorous matter comprises the addition of an anoxic compartment inside the aeration tank in order to perform the nitrification-denitrification process more efficiently. First, ammonia is oxidized to nitrite, which is then converted into nitrate in aerobic conditions (aeration compartment).
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Facultative bacteria then reduce the nitrate to nitrogen gas in anoxic conditions (anoxic compartment). Moreover, the organisms used for the phosphorus uptake (Polyphosphate Accumulating Organisms) are more efficient under anoxic conditons. These microorganisms accumulate large amounts of phosphates in their cells and are setttled in the secondary clarifier or removed as waste of activated sludge (WAS). The yield of PAOs (Polyphosphate Accumulating Organisms) is reduced between 70-80% under aerobic conditions. Even though the phosphorus can be removed upstream of the aeration tank by chemical precipitation (adding metal ions such as: calcium, aluminum or iron), the biological phophorus removal is more economic due to the saving of chemicals.
