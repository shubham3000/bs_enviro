        Moving-Bed Bioreactors (MBBRs) utilize attached growth media as a substrate for the formation of treatment biofilms. This media is circulated in aerated treatment reactors, ensuring excellent oxygen and substrate transfer to the biomass. MBBR reactors are ideal for both aerobic and anoxic processes and are utilized with mechanical mixers for circulation in anoxireactors for efficient nitrogen removal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Advanced MBBR media provide not only large surface area for biofilm formation but also electrostatic surface charge. Charged surfaces on the media are biologically regenerated as ammonium ions, which are adsorbed and then subsequently nitrified by the biofilm and desorbed. These reactive surfaces increase treatment efficiency and buffer the biofilm communities against toxic compounds in the wastewater.

        Due to the high surface area and surface charge of the media and the robust microbiological communities, MBBRs are ideally suited for high-strength, industrial wastewater applications. In existing wastewater plants, the addition of moving media can expand treatment capacity and improve effluent quality without incurring additional footprint.
