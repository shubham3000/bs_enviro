        An Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) is a specialized facility designed to treat industrial wastewater, Hospital OT and LAB waste water before its safe discharge into the environment. ETPs employ various physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove contaminants, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and minimizing negative impacts on ecosystems and public health.

     <h2><strong>Process of Effluent Treatment Plant:</strong></h2>
    <p>
        ETP takes untreated wastewater as input(influent) and produces effluent as the output of this untreated wastewater and also extracts valuable substances from effluent. It runs through various steps for its successful working such as Equalisation, pH Control, Coagulation, Sedimentation, Filtration, Disinfection, & Sludge Drying.
