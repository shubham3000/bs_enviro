        Moving-Bed Bioreactors (MBBRs) utilize attached growth media as a substrate for the formation of treatment biofilms. This media is circulated in aerated treatment reactors, ensuring excellent oxygen and substrate transfer to the biomass. MBBR reactors are ideal for both aerobic and anoxic processes and are utilized with mechanical mixers for circulation in anoxireactors for efficient nitrogen removal.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Advanced MBBR media provide not only large surface area for biofilm formation but also electrostatic surface charge. Charged surfaces on the media are biologically regenerated as ammonium ions, which are adsorbed and then subsequently nitrified by the biofilm and desorbed. These reactive surfaces increase treatment efficiency and buffer the biofilm communities against toxic compounds in the wastewater.
        Due to the high surface area and surface charge of the media and the robust microbiological communities, MBBRs are ideally suited for high-strength, industrial wastewater applications. In existing wastewater plants, the addition of moving media can expand treatment capacity and improve effluent quality without incurring additional footprint.

    Membrane Bioreactors combine conventional biological treatment (e.g. activated sludge) processes with
    membrane filtration to provide an advanced level of organic and suspended solids removal. When designed
    accordingly, these systems can also provide an advanced level of nutrient removal. In MBR system, the
    membranes are submerged in an aerated biological reactor. The membranes have porosities ranging from
    0.04 microns to 0.8 microns (depending on the manufacturer), which is considered between micro and ultra
    filtration.

    SBR is a sequential batch reactor process. It provides highest treatment efficiency possible in a single step
    biological process. SBR — System is operated in a batch reactor mode which eliminates all the
    inefficiencies of the continuous processes. A batch reactor is a perfect reactor, which ensures 100%
    treatment. Two modules are provided to ensure continuous treatment and into some case one module. The
    complete process takes place in a single reactor, within which all biological treatment steps take place
    sequentially.

    <p>
    This level of filtration allows for high quality effluent to be drawn through the membranes and eliminates the
    sedimentation and filtration processes typically used for wastewater tre-atment. Because the need for
    sedimentation is eliminated, the biological process can operate at a much higher mixed liquor
    concentration. This dramatically reduces the process tankage required and allows many existing plants to
    be upgraded without adding new tanks. To provide optimal aeration and scour around the membranes, the
    mixed liquor is typically kept in the 1.0-1.2% solids range,which is 4 times that of a conventional plant.

      The activated sludge process is a type of biological wastewater treatment process for treating sewage or industrial wastewaters using aeration and a biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoa. It uses air (or oxygen) and microorganisms to biologically oxidize organic pollutants, producing a waste sludge (or floc) containing the oxidized material.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution begins with an aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected into the waste water. This is followed by a settling tank to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water. Part of the waste sludge is recycled to the aeration tank and the remaining waste sludge is removed for further treatment and ultimate disposal.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>Process description</strong></h2>
    <p>
      The process takes advantage of aerobic micro-organisms that can digest organic matter in sewage, and clump together by flocculation entrapping fine particulate matter as they do so. It thereby produces a liquid that is relatively free from suspended solids and organic material, and flocculated particles that will readily settle out and can be removed.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items:</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor. Settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water. Treatment of nitrogenous or phosphorous matter comprises the addition of an anoxic compartment inside the aeration tank in order to perform the nitrification-denitrification process more efficiently. First, ammonia is oxidized to nitrite, which is then converted into nitrate in aerobic conditions (aeration compartment).
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Facultative bacteria then reduce the nitrate to nitrogen gas in anoxic conditions (anoxic compartment). Moreover, the organisms used for the phosphorus uptake (Polyphosphate Accumulating Organisms) are more efficient under anoxic conditons. These microorganisms accumulate large amounts of phosphates in their cells and are setttled in the secondary clarifier or removed as waste of activated sludge (WAS). The yield of PAOs (Polyphosphate Accumulating Organisms) is reduced between 70-80% under aerobic conditions. Even though the phosphorus can be removed upstream of the aeration tank by chemical precipitation (adding metal ions such as: calcium, aluminum or iron), the biological phophorus removal is more economic due to the saving of chemicals.
